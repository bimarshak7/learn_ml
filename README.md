# Health Insurance Cost Prediction


There are many factors that affect how much health insurance companies charge us. Here are some of the major factors considered by the companies in USA that affect how much health insurance premium cost.


* **age:**  age of primary beneficiary

* **sex:**  insurance contractor gender, female, male

* **bmi:**  Body mass index is a value derived from the mass and height of a person. The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is universally expressed in units of kg/mÂ², resulting from mass in kilograms and height in metres

* **children:**  Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents

* **smoker:**  Smoking

* **region:**  the beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest

My goal is to predict the premium cost for Health Insurance base on above factors.
